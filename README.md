# 🚀 The Almost Impossible Chessboard Puzzle 🎮

## Thrilled to Announce My Latest Project!

I’m excited to share that I’ve just completed my personal web development project:  
**"The Almost Impossible Chessboard Puzzle"**!

This project was originally part of the **MACT (Mathematical Algorithmic and Computational Thinking)** course in my first semester of **B.Tech in Mathematics and Computing** at **Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology (DA-IICT)**, under the guidance of **Prof. Sunitha Vadivel Murugan**.  
Along with my talented teammates, **Khanak Patel** and **Megh Jagtap**, we researched extensively through sites, videos, and research papers to develop this intriguing puzzle.

As a personal challenge, I took the concept further and built a full-fledged website for the puzzle, now part of my personal portfolio!

## 📝 Rules of the Game

- You are given an 8x8 chessboard with 64 coins, each coin showing either heads (H) or tails (T).  
- A key is hidden under one of the coins. Its exact location is unknown to both prisoners at the start.  
- **Prisoner 1 (Fox)** enters the room first and sees the location of the key as shown by the warden. Fox must flip exactly one coin to convey the key’s location to **Prisoner 2 (Ell)**.  
- **Prisoner 2 (Ell)** enters the room afterward and must deduce the key's location based solely on the current arrangement of the coins.  
- Both prisoners can agree on a strategy beforehand but cannot communicate once the game begins. The warden knows the strategy.
